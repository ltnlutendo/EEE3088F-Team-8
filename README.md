# EEE3088F-Team-8
Team collaboration for the EEE3088F 2022, HAT project



The HAT will serve primarily as a covid compliancy monitor for enclosed public venues like
lecture theatres, classrooms and supermarkets. The Hat will be connected to a STM32
discovery board which will handle computations and other processing. It will make use of
ultrasonic sensors that will be mounted on the venue entrance to capture the number of people
entering the venue. It will also incorporate pressure and temperature sensors to specifically
monitor room ventilation and determine whether the room is safe enough for its occupants.
Besides, covid related uses, the HAT could be used to compile statistical records on lecture
attendance or supermarket peak times. Furthermore, it can be used to monitor overcrowding on
shuttles like the Jammie buses in accordance with traffic and road safety regulations.

This is an ongoing project which is constantly improved
